# NFTs_for_kids
This repository contains all the documents I used to present the OnChainBunnies to the class of Ann-Julie.
We did this workshop for a group of 15 kids (9-12 years).

# What do you need?
- Copy of blockchain/ Steps for every kid (see files)
- Fake coins
- Something to present an NFT (we used a sticker)
- One computer for every 2 kids

# Step 1: Presentation
In this repository you find a presentation we used to explain blockchain, NFTs and OnChainBunnies to the children.

# Step 2: Game Proof-Of-Work
To explain the Proof-Of-Work consensus algorithm we made a game where every child represents a node.
They all got a copy of the blockchain on paper (see file).
Two kids come to the front and one sells an NFT to the other. 
Then a riddle gets displayed. The kid who gives the answer the first 'wins'.
The winner is allowed to change his/her copy of the blockchain and tell the other kids what they have to change as well so that the NFT can be sold.
The winner gets also some reward coins.

# Step 3: Create digital wallet + receive NFT (Goerli)
Ann-Julie made her own NFT collection for the class we deployed earlied on Goerli.
The kids create their own wallet in groups of 2. 
We showed the steps in front on how they create their own metamask wallet.
They also receive a paper with steps on how they import their wallet at home.
On this paper they also have to write down their seed phrase.
PROTIP: Let the teachers create a wallet in advance so they know the steps.

After creating their wallet we airdropped an NFT on the Goerli tesnet to all of them.

To create the second wallet of the pairs, we orginzed a game. 
Now they had to create their wallet without our help and as fast as possible

# Step 4: Create own NFT
They were allowed to draw their own NFT in a paint program.
We said they could only use geometric figures, because that's also the task I gave Ann-Julie to generate the OnChainBunnies.
If you convert it to SVG later on, it's way cheaper to put them on-chain.

# Warm call: If you organize this workshop please upload the images of the kids (by opening a Pull request). Maybe we can create an NFT collection of this one day :)
